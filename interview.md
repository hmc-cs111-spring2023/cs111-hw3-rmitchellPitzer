# Interview project

## The user and a language

This section describes who the project would serve and why a language might be a
good way to meet their needs.

    The user is someone who needs to manage heat pumps in different homes.
    A language might be a good way to manage individual parameters of different
    heat pumps.

### What's the need?

_What need is met by your idea? Who are you helping? What is that person's
experience like now? What would their experience be like if you could help
them?_

    The need is met as many different parameters need to be taken into account
    before installing a heat pump. I would be helping people like my brother who
    need to install heat pumps to be as energy efficient as possible. Their
    experience currently is that they need to take different temperatures, different
    readings from data not publicly available, and analyze this data to determine
    when best to have heatpumps running. This experience might be easier if
    a DSL was used to input these parameters and output automatically the most
    efficient and best parameters.

### Why a language?

_Why is a DSL appropriate for your user(s)? How does it address the need?_

    A DSL is appropriate because it is specific to a domain and would
    eliminate human error from analyzing data. It would also speed up
    this process of gathering data/analyzing it.

### Why you?

_What excites you about this idea? How did you come up with it?_

    I like the idea of saving energy/cost and that having an impact
    on potentially millions of people! I came up with it after
    speaking to my brother, who is an energy consultant. I think.
    I'm not sure what his official job title is but his job is to
    come up with ways for businesses and homes to use less energy
    and to save money by using renewable energy sources, and he
    thought that step in the process could be automated by a
    DSL.

### Domain

_Describe the project's domain in five words._

    Automated parameter setup of heatpumps.

### Interface (syntax)

_How might the user interact with the language? What does programming look
like? Why is this the right way to interact with the problem domain?_

    The user could interact with the language by inputting in
    specific parameters they have access to. This could look like
    a terminal window or a text file. This is the right way to
    interact with the domain as the information applicable could
    vary from building to building.

### Operation (semantics)

_What might happen when a program runs? How does a program interact with the
user? What kinds of errors might occur, and how might they be communicated to
the user?_

    When a program runs the right parameters for these heatpumps
    could be output either as a csv file or a text file. The program
    could interact with the user through a terminal/command prompt, which
    could output an error in the case that syntax errors occur.

### Expressiveness

_What should be easy to do in this language? What should be possible, but
difficult? What should be impossible or very difficult?_

    It should be easy to input in an amount of parameters and get back a
    result. I don't think it should be possible to do anything else.

### Related work

_Are there any other DSLs in this domain? If not, describe how you know there
aren't and conjecture why not. If so, describe them and provide links. How well
do they address the need? Are there any particularly admirable qualities of the
language? Are there parts of the language you think could be improved?_

    I don't think so? I'm not sure. This isn't my domain, and I know very
    little about it, so I can not know. That being said, according to the
    person I interviewed, something like this "would be worth millions". 

## The Project

This section examines whether the idea makes for a good CS 111 project.

### Suitability

_If someone were to work on this project, what percentage of their time would be
spent directly engaging in the **language** aspects of this project (e.g.,
making language design decisions), as opposed to "systems" aspects of the
project (e.g., implementing a complicated semantics that doesn't require a lot
of language design)?_

    I think a large amount of the time would be spent in systems aspects as
    they'd have to take into account much of the process for installing and
    setting up these heat pumps. This would mean lots of modeling, defining
    specific situations with different variables, and I don't think a lot
    of time would be spent on the language aspects of the project. Maybe
    90/10. 

### Scope

_How big an idea is this? How ambitious is this project?_

    I think it's an insanely big and insanely ambitious project.

### Benefits and drawbacks

_Why might this be a good idea for a project? Why might this not be a good idea
project?_

    I think it'd be a good idea for a project becuase it does have a huge
    benefit to the users, and I also think it would not be a good idea for
    a project as it would require an insane amount of work and would be
    largely focused on systems aspects of the project instead of the
    language.
